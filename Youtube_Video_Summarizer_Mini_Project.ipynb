              "\"You know, only about 15% of you will watch this video\\nthrough to the end. Think about that in a few minutes. Most of you will be gone,\\nlured away by another notification. A fresh piece of content,\\nsome shiny new dopamine hit. And no, I don't blame you. I get it. Your brain, my brain. In fact, everyone's brain is in the midst\\nof a massive rewiring, we’ve never seen in human history. It's a pattern that's literally happening\\nacross every social platform. You know that restless feeling,\\nthat itch to check your phone. That inability to stay put. Some call it. And let me confess something. I'm making this video because honestly,\\nlately I've been feeling all of it too. The same restlessness, that same short\\ncircuit in my inability to read books. I'm finding it harder to sit\\nthrough movies, TV shows, and harder to simply think I am terrified\\nof losing this ability. But I can't quit social media\\nbecause it's my job. So I thought,\\nwhat better way to study this phenomenon, the history, the future,\\nand why all of it is happening. And I also share everything that I learned\\nwith all of you guys. Those who stuck till here. Thank you so much. Stick with me for the next 10 minutes\\nbecause I'll show you exactly what's happening inside your head,\\nwhy it's happening and what we can do about it. It's really important because we feel if\\nwe don't understand how our little ancient hardware reacts to modern overload,\\nwe risk losing the very capacities, that’s focus, creativity,\\ninsight that makes us human. As you're watching this video, like right now,\\nyour brain is being rewired entire time, but you understand\\nexactly what's going on. You need to look at how our brains evolved\\nto process information in the first place.\\nWe're going back in time. Let me introduce you to the OG human,\\nthe hunter gatherer. His brain, which is basically\\nvery identical to us, evolved over hundreds of thousands of years\\nto do something very specific. That's pay attention to what matters\\nand filter out what doesn't. For example, when he sees a predator\\nor sees berries, that's his food. His brain releases dopamine, a chemical\\nthat says, hey, this is important. Pay attention to this. But fast forward to 2024. You know, we still have that\\nsame basic brain architecture. But now, instead of the occasional\\npredator that we stumble upon now and then, our brains are continuously being flooded\\nwith these same reward chemicals. Not for finding food or avoiding danger. But for this, every notification,\\nevery like every scroll, each one\\ntriggering the same ancient circuitry. You know, our brains\\ncan't tell the difference between a crucial survival\\ncue and a funny cat video. Both deliver novelty, both release\\ndopamine. The result? A relentless cycle of seeking reward. But even meaningless content\\ncan feel oddly compelling. Neuroscientists call our brain’s\\nadaptability, neuroplasticity. In simpler times, this slow, careful\\nrewiring took generations. But around 2007,\\ncoinciding with the smartphone revolution and the rise of social media,\\nthis rewiring went into hyperdrive. Within a decade and a half, we have\\ntrained our brains to crave constant novelty, fragmenting our attention\\nand making deep focus feel unnatural. We're facing what scientists call\\na cognitive evolutionary mismatch. You see our environment change at light\\nspeed. While our brains still think\\nwe are in the Pleistocene. You know, I'm\\nvery amused by how stupid yet how smart our little brains are. So in the 1960s,\\nthere was this Canadian theorist, Marshall McLuhan, who famously said,\\nthe medium is the message. He basically argued that form\\nof communication shapes society's\\nthinking more than the actual content. And I feel like today,\\nthis couldn't be more relevant. You see, before we had TV, radio. But now the media\\nlandscape is dominated by platforms which are engineered for short bursts\\nof attention. Vertical video feeds, 15 second clips. Trending hashtags. And all of these platforms\\nreward engagement above all else. That means more novelty, more shock,\\nmore instantaneous gratification. So the message we are receiving\\nisn't just funny dances or cat names. The deeper message is that brains should\\nexpect immediate rewards at all times. And the medium’s\\ndesign, endless scrolling, autoplay infinite content,\\nconditions are cognitive patterns. We might think that we have control\\nover what we watch, we’re choosing what we watch, but the truth is that\\nthe medium chooses how we think. And that's\\nwhat we're sort of being controlled by. We're living in a world where attention\\nis currency, and every swipe is a micro transaction\\nin a massive attention economy. So over time, as platforms capitalize\\non this, more and more, it’ll rewire our neural pathways, making sustained\\nthought more and more difficult. And here's another interesting thing\\nI learned while researching about content, media and our brains\\nthat I wanted to share with you. So back in 1976,\\nthe evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins introduced the concept\\nof “memes” in his book “The Selfish Gene”. If you look at the original\\nmeaning of the word “meme”, it meant a unit of cultural transmission\\nspreading from mind to mind. How genes spread biologically. But decades later, internet has turned\\n“meme” into a household word describing funny images, jokes and viral trends\\nthat replicate endlessly online. But let's actually pause for a moment\\nand think about what “memes” represent tiny packets of information that spread\\nat the speed of light. Means today are often low\\ncontext, high on emotional punch. They are cultural shorthand, intellectual\\npopcorn transmitted in seconds. And you know, Gen\\nZ and Gen Alpha have entire vocabularies born not from books or lived experiences,\\nbut from memes and viral references. “Shawty”, “blud”, like,\\nthat's good, that's rizz. It's rizz right there. Mad lit, on God on God, no cap. Skibidi\\nToilet, Gyatt, Ohio, Fanum Tax, Rizz. This is literally\\nhow teenagers are talking right now. You know, there are random songs\\nthat are going viral on the internet. Slangs like “moye-moye”. These micro cultural phenomena,\\nthey spread instantly umoored\\nfrom geography, history or depth. And if you think about it, it's\\nnot just the audience. Even brands are adapting to this shift\\nto look more relatable to the audience. Welcome to the Goated Ganga Gurukulam. We have got the squad, the energy, we are the OG. The drip check on the point. Tech level, low key\\ntop tier hit different. I feel like Dawkins’ idea of a “meme”\\nas a cultural replicator, has actually become\\nsupercharged in the digital age. Memes now are shaping our worldview\\nare inside jokes are language, the way we talk, our values,\\nwithout us ever slowing down to reflect. Yes, they're fun, they're fast,\\nand they reinforce a new neural wiring that's quick hits of amusement,\\nthen on to the next thing. You know, if you look at the repercussion\\nof all of it on the younger generations, Gen Z and Gen Alpha,\\nthe result is unprecedented. Teachers say their students struggle\\nto focus on a single lesson. Kids were born into this era of iPads\\nand iPhones at the age 2, have neural pathways\\nshaped by infinite feeds from day one. Studies show declining reading rates,\\nreduced tolerance for slower media like long form\\njournalism, documentary films, and an impatience with anything\\nthat isn't immediately stimulating. And it's all quite concerning,\\nbecause as we change our neural architecture, our neural pathways,\\nmental health professionals have noticed increases in anxiety, restlessness\\nand the inability to handle boredom. You know, boredom, once\\nthe crucible of creative thought is now treated like it's a disease. Why sit and daydream\\nwhen we can instantly check social media? Why reflect upon anything in the world\\nwhen social algorithms promise\\nsomething entertaining right now? This is essentially what we are calling\\nbrain rot, the Oxford Dictionary word of the year, is this profound shift\\non how we process information. Instead of building deep conceptual\\nunderstanding of anything, we skip along the surface of data streams. Instead of remembering what we saw, we rely on the internet\\nas an external hard drive. Instead of forming stable\\ndopamine baselines where normal activities\\ncan also be satisfying, we are perpetually chasing\\nmicro doses of digital dopamine. And to be honest, there is another side\\nto this, another side that we can pick. You know, instead of mindlessly scrolling,\\nwhat if we use the internet to learn something genuinely valuable? Now, I know it's also easy\\nto blame the platform for a distraction, but we need to remember that\\nit's also a very powerful enabler. Without it, some of the biggest companies\\nin the world wouldn't exist. And even me, I own much of my career\\nto the internet learning skills outside traditional college, connecting\\nwith people and building businesses. All of it happened online. In this hyper competitive world,\\nthe right content, right\\nresources, can also help you stand out. With just a few clicks, you can learn almost anything, sharpen\\nyour abilities, and gain real leverage. Of course, navigating this crowded\\ndigital landscape isn't always easy. That's why we want to guide\\nyou towards something truly worthwhile. If you are a developer\\nor aspiring to become one, IBM Skills Build has amazing\\nonline courses designed just for you.

You dive into the fundamentals\\nof Natural Language Processing, or NLP and discover\\nhow to apply them to real world scenarios. By the end of it, you will be able to build a chat bot\\nthat offers options and suggestions using both pre-built and custom\\nconversations to generate engaging dialog. And I'll tell you the best part\\nyou can access the course for absolutely free on IBM Skills Build platform,\\nand you don't have to spend days on it. All it takes\\nis just one hour of your time. Be sure to enroll, complete the course, and share your digital stickers online\\nwith the hashtag IBM skills. But if you are interested\\nand want to check out the course, I'm putting a link in the description\\nbelow, now back to the video. I have a question for you. Have you ever thought\\nabout how our memories form? You know our brain, it basically forms\\nmemories through repeated attention. Now, of course,\\nthis is a little more simplified, but when we focus deeply, the hippocampus consolidates\\nnew information into long term storage. But here's another thought for you. What if we never concentrate long enough? What if every 30 seconds we interrupt\\nourselves with a notification? Our brain\\nnever gets the chance to encode a memory. The result? Just in time memory, where we trust Google\\nor social feeds to provide answers on demand. The brain literally just goes like why store any knowledge\\nwhen it's all just a click away? Dopamine, again, our favorite\\nneurotransmitter, is at the heart of this. Each swipe, each tap or click can trigger\\na small dopamine release. Reinforcing this habit. It’s\\nbasically like a slot machine. Maybe the next pull\\nwill deliver something amazing. And this intermittent reinforcement\\nis highly addictive. Training us for shallowness. Neuroscientist Nicholas Carr\\nonce warned in his book “The Shallows” that the internet changes not only what\\nwe think about, but how we think. And honestly, today\\nthat warning feels like. The attention\\neconomy, companies monetizing every second of your gaze.,\\nhas economic implication as well. You know, productivity suffers\\nwhen we can't sustain focus, creativity declines\\nwhen we never let our minds wander. And if you think about the second order\\neffect of all of this, countries itself depend on citizens\\nwho can grapple with complex issues, think critically and consider\\nmultiple viewpoints. But how will we do all of it if we are trained to consume\\ncontent in tiny, disjointed snippets? You know, as we become more distractible,\\nwe risk losing our competitive advantage. True innovation emerges from deep work,\\nfrom extended periods of uninterrupted thought. And if we can't tolerate silence\\nor complexity, you might struggle to solve any big problems\\nwhen there's so much to solve. All of the problems that we face right now\\nglobally, they all require sustained attention,\\nnot a flurry of half read headlines. So the question is, what do we do? Are we doomed to become shallow,\\nrestless scrollers. Well, there's some good news. You know, neuroplasticity actually works\\nboth ways. Just how we adapted to this\\nhigh dopamine environment. We can also adapt to the alternative. We can retrain our brains. But of course, it's not going to be easy. It's going to be like building muscle\\nafter years of being a couch potato. It takes a lot of intentional effort, and I think the very first step\\nis just recognizing the problem and having awareness\\nand some intentionality towards fixing it. I'll tell you some things that I've been\\ntrying that have work for me. First is essentially just admitting\\nthat this is something I need to fix. Second is progressive overload\\nfor attention. If you’ve trained your brain to watch\\n15 second reels every day, don't expect to read a heavy 500 page book\\nright away. Start small, 5 minutes of focus reading,\\nthen 10, then 20. Over time you will build mental endurance. Your concentration muscles strengthens\\nwith incremental challenges. Second is environmental design,\\nwhich has really, really helped me. You know, our environment\\nnudges our behavior. So if your phone is always on your desk,\\nyou will grab it. If you put it in another room when you're\\nworking or when you're studying. If you use website blockers,\\nor add a lot of friction to access infinite content,\\nthat could work for you. Basically, what we have to do is make\\nfocus the path of least resistance, but make distraction\\na path with a lot of resistance. Next is just rebalancing\\nthe dopamine little bit. You know, I've started setting aside periods,\\nmaybe 30 minutes in a day or maybe two. Not in a day where I just sit\\nand literally do nothing stimulating. No phone, no TV, no podcast,\\nno YouTube, nothing. But I feel like if you push through your brain\\nsomewhere, resets this dopamine baseline. After a few weeks, reading a book\\nor just having a slow conversation can feel rewarding again.\\nAnd this isn't pseudo science. Neuroscientists have confirmed\\nthat reducing stimulus overload can restore your capacity for deep focus. And lastly, it's just mindful consumption. Next time you watch a video\\nor read an article, reflect afterward. What did I learn? How does it connect to what I know? I think a lot of schools and institutions also need to start\\nthinking about this problem. Something that schools might need to start\\nteaching is attention literacy. Addressing the problem with students. Employers could incentivize\\ndeep work over constant slack pings. I feel like platforms\\nalso somewhere should start considering more humane design principles, less infinite scroll, and concentrated\\nmore towards conscious pausing. And as consumers, we can definitely demand better interfaces\\nthat respect our cognitive limits. So if there's somebody\\nwho has stuck with me till here, you are part of the 15%. You've demonstrated that with intention and interest,\\nwe can resist the pull of endless novelty. I would like to leave you guys\\nwith a few closing thoughts. Remember, 100,000 years ago, our ancestors learned to pay attention\\nselectively for survival. But today, survival might depend\\non relearning how to pay attention deeply. We don't have to reject technology. But you must insist that things\\nthat makes us human focus, memory,\\ncreativity are worth protecting. So after this video ends,\\ntry not to click away immediately. Sit quietly for a minute. Let the information settle. Ask yourself, what resonated with me? What can I do differently tomorrow? I feel like this small act of\\nintentional reflection fights brain rot. It reclaims a piece of your neural\\nreal estate from the infinite scroll. And lastly,\\nI have a small request from all of you. If you are somebody\\nwho has gone through this and fought this and are taking intentional action, or if you’ve found some things\\nthat have worked for you, please, please, please do\\nshare them in the comments below. I would love to read it. I feel like it will also be valuable for all the other people\\nwho are watching this video. Yeah, that's about it. My name is Achina\\nMayya. Thank you so much for watching.
